There is currently no system for identification of these track fittings—i.e., elastic rail clips, rail pads, liners—and sleepers, with integration to the UDM portal enabling mobile-based scanning for vendor lot number, date of supply, warranty period, inspection dates, etc. This gap is critical for quality assessment and performance management of fittings.<br/><br/>\n<b>Description</b><br/><br/>\nThis problem statement envisages a unified system for laser-based QR code marking on track fittings to enable mobile scanning and identification of elastic rail clips, rail pads, liners, and sleepers, along with integration to the UDM (User Depot Module) on www.ireps.gov.in and the TMS (Track Management System) on www.irecept.gov.in. With the use of AI, the system should extract all essential details of each fitting item, including inspections at all stages—from manufacturing and supply to in-service performance—and pinpoint exceptions for quality monitoring. Laser-based QR codes are already prevalent in other industries.<br/><br/>\n<b>Expected Solution</b><br/><br/>\nInnovative solutions are invited through Smart India Hackathon 2025 to develop and implement a system addressing identification of bulk supply materials, their performance issues, and effective inventory management and quality monitoring actions for safety performance of fittings.<br/><br/>\n\n• <b>Hardware Solution:</b> Design and implement laser-based QR code imprints on bulk supply items of track fittings and sleepers.<br/>\n• <b>Software Solution:</b> Develop QR code linkage and integrate with the UDM and TMS portals; enable mobile scans to generate AI-based reports related to vendor, supply, warranty, inspections, and support inventory management, etc.",

There is currently no system for identification of these track fittings—i.e., elastic rail clips, rail pads, liners—and sleepers, with integration to the UDM portal enabling mobile-based scanning for vendor lot number, date of supply, warranty period, inspection dates, etc. This gap is critical for quality assessment and performance management of fittings. \n Description \nThis problem statement envisages a unified system for laser-based QR code marking on track fittings to enable mobile scanning and identification of elastic rail clips, rail pads, liners, and sleepers, along with integration to the UDM (User Depot Module) on www.ireps.gov.in and the TMS (Track Management System) on www.irecept.gov.in. With the use of AI, the system should extract all essential details of each fitting item, including inspections at all stages—from manufacturing and supply to in-service performance—and pinpoint exceptions for quality monitoring. Laser-based QR codes are already prevalent in other industries. \n Expected Solution \nInnovative solutions are invited through Smart India Hackathon 2025 to develop and implement a system addressing identification of bulk supply materials, their performance issues, and effective inventory management and quality monitoring actions for safety performance of fittings. \n\n•  Hardware Solution:  Design and implement laser-based QR code imprints on bulk supply items of track fittings and sleepers. \n•  Software Solution:  Develop QR code linkage and integrate with the UDM and TMS portals; enable mobile scans to generate AI-based reports related to vendor, supply, warranty, inspections, and support inventory management, etc."

The Indian Standard, IS 1418: 2009 \"Determination of gold in gold bullion, gold alloys and gold jewellery/artefacts - Cupellation (Fire Assay) method\" prescribes the fire assay test method for determining the fineness of gold in gold bullion, alloys, and jewellery/artefacts.<br/><br/>\n\nThe fire assay testing method, though globally accepted and accurate, involves a destructive testing process wherein a sample of 250-500 mg is taken from the item by scrapping, drilling, or cutting. The method may lead to the damage of the article, rendering it unsellable, especially when dealing with a few or single article. However, the gold loss incurred during testing is almost negligible. Additionally, the process emits hazardous substances like lead oxides and nitrous fumes.<br/><br/>\n\nFurther, BIS has also formulated an Indian Standard on method of test using ED-XRF (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence), i.e., IS 18458: 2023 \"Jewellery and precious metals ED-XRF test - Method of test\". This Indian Standard prescribes a non-destructive testing method to verify the fineness of the gold jewellery. However, the use of ED-XRF as a non-destructive method to determine the fineness is only applicable to homogenous gold jewellery. In addition, IS 18458: 2023 also has a provision for determination of fineness of jewellery by destructive testing, which is more suited for non-homogeneous jewellery.<br/><br/>\n\nThere is another Indian Standard developed by BIS, IS 16901: 2022 \"Jewellery and precious metals determination of high purity gold, platinum and palladium - difference method using ICP-OES\". This method uses ICP-OES and is applicable only for high purity gold (999 ppt and above). ICP-OES is also a destructive testing method.<br/><br/>\n\nIndia's gold jewellery industry is highly diverse, encompassing various types such as casted jewellery, handmade pieces with soldered joints, hollow and filled jewellery, gold-plated items, and studded ornaments using various jewellery manufacturing techniques. While casted jewellery is relatively homogeneous, the majority-particularly handmade and hollow varieties-are structurally complex and heterogeneous. This variability presents significant challenges in testing and hallmarking.<br/><br/>\n\nIn the existing fire assay testing method, heterogeneity is addressed by melting the sample before testing.

These alterations are designed to evade detection by regulators while enabling cheating during operation. \n Problem Description \nDevelop a robust and intelligent system to detect, prevent, and alert against tampering in weighing and measuring instruments. The system must be capable of identifying both physical and digital tampering attempts in real time or near-real time. It should ideally include an embedded solution with secure logging, alert triggers, and remote verification capability by Legal Metrology officers.\nThe proposed solution may also leverage Al/ML, digital forensics, tamper-evident Hardware seals, blockchain-backed audit trails, or sensor-based integrity checks. \n Key Functional Requirements \nTamper Detection: \n-Detect unauthorized access to device internals (e.g., seals broken, circuit modifications, etc.) \n-Monitor anomalies in calibration, weight drift, or suspicious patterns \n-Firmware Integrity \n-Secure boot or hash verification for firmware changes \n-Logging of unauthorized software firmware updates \n\nAlert System: \n-Instant tamper alerts to remote Legal Metrology dashboards \n-Optional local visual/audio alarms on tamper detection \n\nData Logging & Traceability: \n-Immutable logs of measurements, maintenance, and access events \n-Optionally backed by blockchain or secure cloud \n\nRemote Monitoring: \n-IoT integration to transmit logs to a centralized monitoring system \n-GPS/ geotagging to detect movement of stationary devices \n Target Participants \nFinal year UG (B.Tech/B.E) students in Electronics, Embedded Systems, Instrumentation, AI/ML. Cybersecurity \n-PG/Ph.D. researchers in IoT Security, Metrology, Data Forensics \n-Startups or academia-industry teams working on compliance technologies \n Evaluation Criteria \n-Innovation (new methods of detection or prevention) \n-Accuracy of tamper detection (false positive/negative rates) \n-Feasibility and cost of integrating the solution into common instruments \n-User Interface & Regulatory Dashboard usability \n-Readiness for field deployment and validation \n Expected Deliverables \n(a) Prototype device or software module to detect tampering (hardware and/or firmware) \n(b) Dashboard or interface for regulators to view alerts and device health \n(c) Tamper-logging and reporting features \n(d) Validation data from controlled tamper scenarios \n(e) Whitepaper/ technical documentation describing architecture, logic, limitations and future potential \n Benefits and Impact \n-Strengthens consumer protection and fairness in trade \n-Builds a proactive regulatory ecosystem using smart devices \n-Reduces inspection burden via automated alerting \n-Enables certification of tamper-proof weighing/measuring instruments \n-Contributes to digital trust in India's commerce and metrology infrastructure \n Mentorship and Resources \n-Mentorship from Legal Metrology and cybersecuirty experts \n-Access to LM Act & Rules/ OIML Recommendations, guidelines, testing labs, etc. \n Future Prospects \n-Development of National Digital Registry for compliant instruments \n-Integration with e-maap portal for real-time monitoring \n-Standardization of tamper-detection modules in certified devices \n-Development of tamper-proof metrology solutions"

However, significant challenges persist: \n• Legacy records of Individual Forest Rights (IFR), Community Rights (CR), and Community Forest Resource Rights (CFR) are scattered, non-digitized, and difficult to verify. \n• There is no centralized, real-time visual repository (e.g., an FRA Atlas) of FRA claims and granted titles. \n• Integration of satellite-based asset mapping (land, water bodies, farms, etc.) with FRA data is missing. \n• Integration of legacy data with FRA Atlas is missing. \n• Decision-makers lack a Decision Support System (DSS) to layer Central Sector Schemes (CSS) benefits (e.g., PM-KISAN, Jal Jeevan Mission, MGNREGA, DAJGUA (3 ministries)) for FRA patta holders. \n\nProject Objectives \n1. Digitize and standardize legacy data of FRA claims, verifications, and pattas, and integrate with FRA Atlas. FRA patta holders’ shapefiles to be integrated. \n2. Create an FRA Atlas showing potential and granted FRA areas using AI and satellite data. \n3. Integrate a WebGIS portal to visualize and manage spatial and socio-economic data. \n4.

    "Description": "Background \nAntimicrobials are vital in ensuring animal health and productivity in modern livestock systems. However, inappropriate and excessive use of these drugs can result in antimicrobial residues in animal-derived food products and contribute to the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)—a major global threat to both animal and public health. Monitoring antimicrobial usage (AMU) and ensuring compliance with Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) is crucial to promoting responsible drug use and safeguarding food safety. \n Problem Description \nThere is a growing need for a digital solution that can help track, monitor, and manage antimicrobial usage across livestock farms while ensuring adherence to MRL standards. The proposed system should serve as a centralized digital portal that facilitates: \n\n• Recording and tracking the types, dosages, frequency, and reasons for antimicrobial use in animals both in treatment and through feed. \n• Integration with veterinary prescriptions and treatment logs to monitor compliance. \n• Alert systems for withdrawal periods and MRL compliance prior to the sale or processing of animal products. \n• Real-time dashboards and data visualization tools for analysis of AMU trends across species, regions, and time periods. \n• Use of blockchain or other secure technologies to ensure data integrity and traceability. \n• Mobile app interfaces for easy data entry by farmers and veterinarians in field conditions. \n\nThis digital platform would contribute to improved antimicrobial stewardship, better regulatory enforcement, and help India align with global AMR mitigation strategies, while also strengthening public trust in livestock products. \n Expected Outcomes \n• Improved antimicrobial stewardship practices at the farm level. \n• Enhanced compliance with MRL norms and regulatory frameworks. \n• Real-time availability of data on AMU for authorities and stakeholders. \n• Data-driven decision-making to inform policy and farm-level action. \n• Capability for trend analysis and automated reporting. \n• Healthier livestock and reduction in antimicrobial residues in food. \n• Improved public health protection and consumer confidence. \n• Contribution to global AMR reduction efforts. \n• Better engagement of farmers and veterinarians through digital tools. \n• Promotion of sustainable and responsible livestock farming practices."

Your goal is to enable clinicians to record traditional medicine diagnoses (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani) using NAMASTE codes, then automatically map them to global ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) identifiers—supporting dual/double-coding (One code denoting Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani (TM) and another denoting Biomedicine) for interoperability, analytics and insurance claims. \nYour deliverable is a lightweight micro-service or FHIR terminology plugin offering: \n• A FHIR compliant resource for NAMASTE codes linking to WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda, ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) and compliant with ICD-11 Coding rules. \n• A REST endpoint for auto-complete value-set lookup. \n• A translation operation converting NAMASTE ↔ TM2 codes. \n• An encounter upload endpoint that ingests FHIR Bundles with both code systems. \n• OAuth 2.0–secured access using ABHA tokens and audit-ready metadata. \n Teams should demonstrate \n1. Ingesting the NAMASTE CSV export and generating FHIR CodeSystem + ConceptMap. \n2. Fetching TM2, Biomedicine updates from the WHO ICD-API and merging into your service. \n3. A simple web or CLI interface to search NAMASTE terms, WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda, see mapped TM2 codes, and construct a FHIR ProblemList entry. \n4. Version tracking and consent metadata to satisfy India’s 2016 EHR Standards (FHIR R4, ISO 22600, SNOMED-CT/LOINC semantics). \n Expected Solution \nA lightweight, FHIR R4–compliant terminology micro-service—built to India’s 2016 EHR Standards—that exposes a NAMASTE CodeSystem, WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda, an ICD-11 TM2, Biomedicine ConceptMap, an auto-complete value-set lookup endpoint, a NAMASTE↔TM2 translate operation; ICD-11 Biomedicine look up and a secure FHIR Bundle upload interface (for enabling double coding)."

    "DescriptionHTML": " <b>Background</b><br/><br/>\nThe Ayurvedic herbal supply chain in India is characterised by fragmented networks of smallholder farmers, wild collectors and multiple intermediaries, leading to challenges in ensuring consistent quality, authenticity and sustainable sourcing of medicinal plants. Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines.<br/><br/>\nA blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb's journey—from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., \"CollectionEvent,\" \"QualityTest,\" \"ProcessingStep\") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal—powered by the same blockchain ledger—to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data.

    "Description": "Background \nLocal governments often face challenges in promptly identifying, prioritizing, and resolving everyday civic issues like potholes, malfunctioning streetlights, or overflowing trash bins. While citizens may encounter these issues daily, a lack of effective reporting and tracking mechanisms limits municipal responsiveness. A streamlined, mobile-first solution can bridge this gap by empowering community members to submit real-world reports that municipalities can systematically address. \n Detailed Description \nThe system revolves around an easy-to-use mobile interface that allows users to submit reports in real-time. Each report can contain a photo, automatic location tagging, and a short text or voice explanation, providing sufficient context. These submissions populate a centralized dashboard featuring a live, interactive map of the city's reported issues. The system highlights priority areas based on volume of submissions, urgency inferred from user inputs, or other configurable criteria. \nOn the administrative side, staff access a powerful dashboard where they can view, filter, and categorize incoming reports. Automated routing directs each report to the relevant department such as sanitation or public works based on the issue type and location. System architecture accommodates spikes in reporting, ensuring quick image uploads, responsive performance across devices, and near real-time updates on both mobile and desktop clients. \n Expected Solution \nThe final deliverable should include a mobile platform that supports cross-device functionality and seamless user experience.

    "DescriptionHTML": " <b>Background</b><br/><br/>\nIn FY 2021–22, India generated approximately 1.7 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste daily, of which only 54% was scientifically treated. Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management.<br/><br/>\n<b>Description</b><br/><br/>\nOverview: According to the CPCB’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills. This leaves a significant gap of 37,373 TPD in effective waste management.<br/>\nWaste treatment: The total waste processed/treated across the country is 91,511 TPD. When compared to the total waste generated, which is 1,70,339 TPD, it is found that an average of 54% of the waste is treated/processed across the country.<br/>\nSolid Waste Processing Facilities: A total of 249 Waste-to-Energy plants, 819 Biomass Power plants and 50.8 lakhs small Biogas plants have been set up in the country to generate Power/Biogas/BioCNG.<br/><br/>\n<b>Expected Solutions</b><br/><br/>\nThe proposals aim to develop a strict system to ensure that every citizen is trained on waste management, waste workers get strict training and required safety gear, waste management facilities are present in every ULB/GP, and a dedicated decentralised monitoring system is in place. The solutions are as follows:<br/>\n1. Mandatory training for every citizen: Similar to countries where military training is mandatory for every citizen, in India, there shall be mandatory Waste Management training for every Waste Generator/Citizen. This will ensure source segregation, which will result in better waste management, lesser load on waste management facilities and landfills.<br/>\n  i. Physical training on types of waste, source segregation, how to make compost at home, re-use of plastic, etc.<br/>\n  ii. Distribution of 3 types of dustbins for dry, wet and domestic hazardous waste to every household/citizen.<br/>\n  iii. Distribution of a designed and tested compost making kit to every household/citizen.<br/>\n  iv. App-based monitoring.<br/>\n2. Phase-wise training to all Waste Workers<br/>\n3. Formation of Area Committee for Monitoring – to be called as “Green Champions”: Decentralised approach for Monitoring has to be done at every step of Waste Management for bulk waste generators, residential areas, commercial &amp; Public semi-public building, Industrial buildings, etc.<br/>\n  i. Training of all Waste Generators<br/>\n  ii. Waste Generation: Source segregation happening or not, no wet waste to be collected<br/>\n  iii. Waste Collection happening on ground level<br/>\n  iv. Waste transportation<br/>\n  v. Waste treatment<br/>\n  vi. Waste Disposal<br/>\n4. Incentive based approach: Incentive to Bulk waste generators and other buildings for source segregation.<br/>\n5.

    "Description": "Background \nIn FY 2021–22, India generated approximately 1.7 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste daily, of which only 54% was scientifically treated. Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management. \n Description \nOverview: According to the CPCB’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills. This leaves a significant gap of 37,373 TPD in effective waste management. \nWaste treatment: The total waste processed/treated across the country is 91,511 TPD. When compared to the total waste generated, which is 1,70,339 TPD, it is found that an average of 54% of the waste is treated/processed across the country. \nSolid Waste Processing Facilities: A total of 249 Waste-to-Energy plants, 819 Biomass Power plants and 50.8 lakhs small Biogas plants have been set up in the country to generate Power/Biogas/BioCNG. \n Expected Solutions \nThe proposals aim to develop a strict system to ensure that every citizen is trained on waste management, waste workers get strict training and required safety gear, waste management facilities are present in every ULB/GP, and a dedicated decentralised monitoring system is in place. The solutions are as follows: \n1. Mandatory training for every citizen: Similar to countries where military training is mandatory for every citizen, in India, there shall be mandatory Waste Management training for every Waste Generator/Citizen. This will ensure source segregation, which will result in better waste management, lesser load on waste management facilities and landfills. \n  i. Physical training on types of waste, source segregation, how to make compost at home, re-use of plastic, etc. \n  ii. Distribution of 3 types of dustbins for dry, wet and domestic hazardous waste to every household/citizen. \n  iii. Distribution of a designed and tested compost making kit to every household/citizen. \n  iv. App-based monitoring. \n2. Phase-wise training to all Waste Workers \n3. Formation of Area Committee for Monitoring – to be called as “Green Champions”: Decentralised approach for Monitoring has to be done at every step of Waste Management for bulk waste generators, residential areas, commercial & Public semi-public building, Industrial buildings, etc. \n  i. Training of all Waste Generators \n  ii. Waste Generation: Source segregation happening or not, no wet waste to be collected \n  iii. Waste Collection happening on ground level \n  iv. Waste transportation \n  v. Waste treatment \n  vi. Waste Disposal \n4. Incentive based approach: Incentive to Bulk waste generators and other buildings for source segregation. \n5. Waste Movements in ULBs: Taking example from Karnataka’s Yadgir city, “If you see waste, send photo” similar movement to be made mandatory for every ULB regardless of its size and population, to ensure community participation. \n6. Community Participation: One day of all working staff regardless of employment type to be engaged in Cleaning of Public areas, waste management. Inspired from Cleaning-day followed in schools every week, every waste generator to be responsible for keeping the country clean and contributing to waste management, starting from Govt. sector. \n7. Penalization system: Fines to be imposed and no waste collection for buildings not segregating waste at source as punishment. \n8. Waste Management Facilities to be made available in every ULB: \n  i. Biomethanization plant \n  ii. W-to-E plant \n  iii. Multiple Recycling centres for different types of waste \n  iv. Scrap collection shops – Online app based \n9. Complete Digital App-based system for: \n  i. Training of all Waste Generators \n  ii.

    "DescriptionHTML": " Kochi Metro must decide every night which of its 25 four-car trainsets will enter revenue service at dawn, which remain on standby, and which are held back in the Inspection Bay Line (IBL) for maintenance. The decision hinges on six inter-dependent variables: \n1. Fitness Certificates – validity windows issued by Rolling-Stock, Signalling and Telecom departments.\n2. Job-Card Status – open vs. closed work orders exported from IBM Maximo. \n3. Branding Priorities – contractual commitments that dictate exterior wrap exposure hours. \n4. Mileage Balancing – kilometre allocation to equalise bogie, brake-pad and HVAC wear. \n5. Cleaning &amp; Detailing Slots – available manpower and bay occupancy for interior deep-cleaning. \n6. Stabling Geometry – physical bay positions that minimise nightly shunting and morning turn-out time. \nAt present these data points reside in siloed spreadsheets, manual logbooks, and daily WhatsApp updates. Supervisors reconcile them in a time-compressed window (21:00–23:00 IST) using ad-hoc filters and experience-based heuristics. The process is opaque, non-repeatable, and highly error-prone:\n● Missing a single telecom clearance can force an unscheduled rake withdrawal, eroding the 99.5 % punctuality KPI. \n● Uneven mileage assignment accelerates component fatigue, inflating maintenance cost. \n● Inadequate visibility into branding priorities risks breaching advertiser SLAs, exposing KMRL to revenue penalties. \n● Excessive night-time shunting to rearrange rakes increases energy consumption and track-occupancy safety risk. With fleet size slated to grow to 40 trainsets and two depots by 2027, the existing manual workflow cannot scale linearly—neither in staffing nor in cognitive load.

    "Description": "Kochi Metro must decide every night which of its 25 four-car trainsets will enter revenue service at dawn, which remain on standby, and which are held back in the Inspection Bay Line (IBL) for maintenance. The decision hinges on six inter-dependent variables: \n1. Fitness Certificates – validity windows issued by Rolling-Stock, Signalling and Telecom departments.\n2. Job-Card Status – open vs. closed work orders exported from IBM Maximo. \n3. Branding Priorities – contractual commitments that dictate exterior wrap exposure hours. \n4. Mileage Balancing – kilometre allocation to equalise bogie, brake-pad and HVAC wear. \n5. Cleaning & Detailing Slots – available manpower and bay occupancy for interior deep-cleaning. \n6. Stabling Geometry – physical bay positions that minimise nightly shunting and morning turn-out time. \nAt present these data points reside in siloed spreadsheets, manual logbooks, and daily WhatsApp updates. Supervisors reconcile them in a time-compressed window (21:00–23:00 IST) using ad-hoc filters and experience-based heuristics.

    "DescriptionHTML": " Background:\nCampus offices answer hundreds of repetitive queries-fee deadlines, scholarship forms, timetable changes often from students more comfortable in Hindi or other regional languages. Long queues and communication gaps strain both staff and learners..\n\nDescription:\nWhile answers reside in circulars and PDFs, students prefer conversational guidance. A multilingual chatbot that understands Hindi, English, and an additional local language can deflect routine inquiries, freeing staff for complex tasks. Modern conversational-Al services offer drag-and-drop interfaces. Key requirements include accurate intent recognition, context management across multiple turns, fallback to human contact when necessary, and daily conversation logs for continuous improvement. Embedding the chatbot on the college website and popular messaging platforms maximises reach. Crucially, the solution must respect privacy, ensure response accuracy, and remain maintainable by student volunteers after the hackathon concludes. By focusing on content curation and user-centric design, participants can deliver high impact solution quickly.\n\nExpected Solution:\nStudent innovators should develop a multilingual conversational assistant that ingests institutional FAQs, recognises and responds to student queries in at least five regional languages, maintains context across follow-up questions, logs interactions for review, and integrates seamlessly into the college's existing web and messaging channels-achieving equitable, round-the-clock information access in a user friendly manner.",
